**Machine learning and Data science**

**The central dogma of Molecular Biology**

The central dogma of molecular biology is a theory stating that genetic information flows only in one direction, from DNA, to RNA, to protein, or RNA directly to protein. Our DNA contains the genetic information our cells require to produce proteins. To produce these proteins, cells first transcribe the unique genetic instructions in their DNA into a messenger molecule known as RNA. The final protein product is then created from this. This process is termed gene expression.

There are two phases to gene expression: transcription and translation.  
Transcription happens inside the nucleus. Genetic information from DNA is transcribed into RNA, which are tiny, transportable signals. RNA exits the nucleus and sends these messages to the ribosomes, which are the cell's protein factories. Ribosomes transcribe the messages encoded in the RNA code into a result, which is usually a protein.  
DNA → RNA → Protein

**Genetic Code**  
Proteins are made of RNA, and the information about them is contained in their genetic code. Triplet codons are often made up of three nucleotides and four nitrogenous bases that together code for one amino acid. This means that 64 amino acids, including 4 × 4 x 4 amino acids, are conceivable. Twenty amino acids are present in nature. The Genetic Code degrades as a result. Certain amino acids degenerate because multiple codons might encode the same amino acid at the same time due to the peculiarities of the genetic code. Every amino acid has a single codon, and the codon is the same for all organisms.

**The Central Dogma of Molecular Biology and Machine Learning**

It offers a framework for comprehending the fundamental principles of many biological processes, such as cancer. Significant progress has been made in cancer research in recent years because of the fundamental dogma's integration with machine learning.

**Applications of Machine Learning to Cancer Research:  
**  
1-Gene Expression Analysis: To find patterns linked to the onset, spread, and metastasis of cancer, machine learning algorithms can examine gene expression data produced by RNA sequencing methods.  
2-Protein Structure Prediction: Protein structure prediction has been transformed by machine learning algorithms like AlphaFold.  
3-Drug discovery: By examining enormous databases of biological activity and molecular structures, machine learning can be utilized to find promising drug candidates.  
4-Personalized medicine: To forecast illness risk, prognosis, and treatment response, machine learning algorithms can examine patient-specific data, such as genetics, clinical history, and molecular profiles.
